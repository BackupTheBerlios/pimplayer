About
-----

Pimp is a music player on a client server model. The player can be
controlled with a mpd client or via an pyton interpreter. File system
can be directly played and it is record in a database. Files are
identified by a 'fingerprint' which permits to identify an audio file over
file moving and tag modification.

Moreover, it logs a lot of events on file such as play, stop, seek,
etc in order to get playlists or statistics. 

Pimp is based on pygst for the audio part and sqlalchmy for the data
part.


Run it
------
* Create a mysql user 'pimp'
* Create a mysql database 'pimp_db' (tables are created by pimp if not exist)
* Run :: 
  			
     # python main.py -p 9999 -d pimp_db -u pimp --db-passwd=pimp 2 > 1 > /dev/null &
     
 or with a pyton interpreter ::

     # python -i pimpreter.py -p 9999 -d pimp_db -u pimp --db-passwd=pimp
       >>> player.append("/a/song")
       >>> player.play()


Use it
------
* With mpc::
  
     # mpc -p 9999 add /a/song 
     # mpc -p 9999 play
