About
-----

Pimp is a music player with a client server model. The player can be
controlled with a mpd client or via an pyton interpreter. Files system
can be directly played and file paths are recorded in a database. Files are
identified by a 'fingerprint' which permits to identify an audio file over
file moving and tag modification.

Pimp aims to be a player framework with a really small core. All
features should be implemented in extensions.

It is based on pygst for the audio part and sqlalchmy for the database
part.

It is easy to register functions called on player actions. See
player_event extension for examples.

* Player_event extension logs a lot of events on file such as play,
  stop, seek, etc in order to get playlists or statistics.

* Tag extension permit to Note and Comment a song.

Get it
------
Currently, you have to use git ::
	   
	   $ git clone git://git.berlios.de/pimplayer 
	   
or you can `browse source code <http://git.berlios.de/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=pimplayer;a=summary>`_ .
	

Run it
------
* See dependencies section
* Create a mysql user 'pimp'
* Create a mysql database 'pimp_db' (tables are created by pimp if not exist)
* Run with an interpreter :: 
  			
     $ python -i pimpreter.py -p 9999 -d pimp_db -u pimp --db-passwd=pimp
     
 or for a deamon ::

     $ python main.py -p 9999 -d pimp_db -u pimp --db-passwd=pimp
     

Use it
------
* With mpc::
  
     $ mpc -p 9999 add /a/song  # Use absolute path
     $ mpc -p 9999 play
     
* With pimpreter::
  
  >>> player.appendByPath("/a/song")
  >>> player.play()

  You can use tabulation on player object which is documented in :doc:`reference`

* Note and Comment in pimpreter::

  >>> Note.Add(player.current(),4)
  >>> Note.GetNote(player.current()) # Compute notes average
  >>> Comment.Add(player[3],"comments")
  >>> Note.Add(Url("/a/file"),4)
  >>> player.sort(key=Note.GetNote,reverse=True) # Sort playlist by note



Dependencies
------------
* pygst : python gstreamer package
* sqlalchemy >= 0.6 : python sql ORM package
* socketserver : python package to implement server
* sox (to generate audiofingerprint)  
       
Features
--------
* A Mpd client can be used to control Pimp (partially comptatible)
* Audio part is based on gstreamer
* Files are identified by a fingerprint
* No database update are required (files are added to the database)
* A python interpreter can be used to control Pimp 

Limits
------
* Just 3 audio formats are currently available: mp3, ogg, flac.
  But it's not so hard to add them: add them in File module
* Mpd library isn't currently supported.
