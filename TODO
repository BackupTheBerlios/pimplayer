* Add all gstreamer supported file.
* Improve (from scratch !) the file module.
* Secure the PlayerPlaylist against concurrency: Add a critical section around all command methods.
* Imrpove QUeue : should use "about-signal" : http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gst-plugins-base-plugins/html/gst-plugins-base-plugins-playbin2.html#GstPlayBin2--audio-sink
* Mpd handler : plchanges command send the whole playlist instead of a diff.

ROAD MAP
* Add a dynamic log destination. For instance, print to stdout message or to a file.

* Cache system. 
  Declare some removable device. When a song is played on this device, the file is cached in a local folder.
  
* Add many library mode. The default mode use directly the file system. Another mode could use the file in the database with some annotations.
