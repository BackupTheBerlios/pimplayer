* In playlist.add, get duration from database
* Move player.play to player.__play__
* Test mp3 and ogg file.
* Add all gstreamer supported file.
* Ensure that '"' are treated in a goog manner. Currently, a file path cannot contain '"'. It doesn't work in mpd.py and file.py.
* Improve (from scratch !) the file module.
* Secure the PlayerPlaylist against concurrency: Add a critical section around all command methods.
* Imrpove QUeue : should use "about-signal" : http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gst-plugins-base-plugins/html/gst-plugins-base-plugins-playbin2.html#GstPlayBin2--audio-sink
* mpd handler : plchanges command send the whole playlist instead of a diff.
* It is designed to be modular in order to be able to easily add some
  user extensions.  It is also programmable thought a python
  interpreter. Currently, the interpreter is attached to the server but
  we aim to remote it (pyro ?).


ROAD MAP
* Add a dynamic log destination. For instance, print to stdout message or to a file.

* Cache system. 
  Declare some removable device. When a song is played on this device, the file is cached in a local folder.
  
* Add many library mode. The default mode use directly the file system. Another mode could use the file in the database with some annotations.
