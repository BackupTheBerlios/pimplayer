- The player state (context extension) is saved and restored when it's
  quitted and started.

- A player context is a improved playlist (remember current played
  song, consumed songs in random ...)

- Database entries are on-the-fly added. Don't need database upgrade.

- Files logged in the database are identified with an audio
  fingerprint. Then, a file can be located at different locations.

- Emulate Mpd server to be able to use mpd client (mpc, sonata ...).

- Record player events (play, pause, seek ...) to generate stats,
  playlists ...

- Song can be noted, commented.

- Song fingerprint is stable on file renaming, tag modification.
